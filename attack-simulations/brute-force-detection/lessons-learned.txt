so right now im going through some testing making sure we can do this bruteforce attack
i want this to be as real as possible so i wanna do some test before i start

so far i used nmap to check for open ports

nmap -p 22 <windowsIP>
 after i used nmap command i got back that my port 22 is filtered 

so now i have to find a way to unblock port 22 
i can just walk to the windows 11 machine (victim) and turn off the firewall, But i want to do the hacking way.
now i can use a bashbunny, ducky, or a o.mg cable to do a bunny script plug it to the target and i can go back to my hacking machine 

hopefully this works, now what should i choose ? 

    these tools are malicious becuase they will bypass the windows 11 warnings becuase these tools show as a keyboard 
   option 1) o.mg cable - usb A to usb mini = the first gen, it gives out a wifi signal and you can use any browser to get a gui, from phone or laptop  
   option 2) bashbunny - usb A = you can write a bunny script 3and plug it to the target and waite 5-10 seconds and unplug 
   option 3) rubber ducky - usb A = same as the bashbunny but smaller
